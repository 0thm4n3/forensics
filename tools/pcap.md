Pcapy is a low level network monitoring tool. It sets
the network interface in the [promiscus-mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode)
where all network traffic will be read, not only the
trafic which is addressed to a specific host.

Addidtionaly pcapy can create pcap-dump-files whic can be used
in programms like [whireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/).
